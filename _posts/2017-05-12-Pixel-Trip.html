<p>The fast paced adrenaline pumping color tile matching game!<br/>
All you have to do is match a single set of four colored tiles on a grid as quickly as you can! <br/>
Try Grid Attack where the complexity grows as each grid gets larger, 
try Survival where you travel to each grid with a quick zoom, and finally play Time Attack where you have to race against yourself! <br/>
Post your High Scores and challenge your friends to beat it!</p>
